# OSI Model Overview
The "OSI model" stands for Open Systems Interconnect model and is a conceptual framework built to describe general network communications and the steps required to send and recieve data. It breaks network communication into seven layers with defined functions that separate them.

These layers enable those working with networks to narrow down the source of issues. The visual nature of the model can assist in organization and communication involving the application of software and technology and what aspects of a network they operate on. Best of all, the model can be used as a teaching tool and is a great representation of network functions.
